          <h4>What is the purpose of react router?</h4>
          <p>
            The purpose of React Router is to provide routing functionality to
            React applications. React Router is a popular library in the React
            ecosystem that allows developers to implement client-side routing in
            their single-page applications.
            <br />
            <br />
            In a single-page application, the content is dynamically updated
            without the need for a full page reload. React Router enables
            developers to define different routes for different components or
            views within the application. It provides a way to map URLs to
            specific components, allowing users to navigate between different
            views without triggering a server request.
            <br />
            <br />
            React Router offers several key features:
            <br />
            <span>Declarative routing:</span> React Router allows developers to
            define routes using a declarative syntax, specifying the desired
            component to render for each route.
            <br />
            <span>Nested routing:</span> It supports nested routes, meaning that
            components can be nested within each other, and each component can
            have its own set of routes.
            <br />
            <span>Dynamic routing:</span> React Router allows the definition of
            dynamic routes with URL parameters. These parameters can be accessed
            within the components, providing a way to create dynamic and
            flexible views.
            <br />
            <span>History management:</span> It provides different types of
            history management, including browser history and hash history,
            enabling proper navigation and URL handling.
            <br />
            <span>Route matching and redirection:</span> React Router
            facilitates matching the current URL to the defined routes and
            renders the corresponding component. It also offers redirection
            capabilities to redirect users to specific routes based on certain
            conditions.

          <h4>How does context API work?</h4>
          <p>
          The Context API in React is a feature that allows you to share data between components without passing props manually through the component tree. It provides a way to create a global state or share specific data across components, eliminating the need to pass data through multiple levels of nested components.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Context API consists of three main components:
            <br />
            <span>Context Provider:</span> The context provider component is responsible for creating the context and making the data available to the consuming components. It wraps the components that need access to the shared data.
            <br />
            <span>Context Consumer:</span> The context consumer component is used to consume the data provided by the context provider. It allows components to access the shared data and use it within their own rendering logic.
            <br />
            <span>Context Object:</span> The context object is created using the <strong>createContext</strong> function from the <strong>React</strong> module. It represents the shared data and can be accessed by both the provider and consumer components.
            <br />
            <br />
            Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the Context API works:
            <br />
            <span>Create a context object:</span> Use the <strong>createContext</strong> function to create a new context object. This object will hold the shared data and can be accessed by provider and consumer components.
            <br />
            <span>Wrap provider components:</span> Wrap the components that need access to the shared data with the context provider component. Pass the shared data as a value prop to the provider component.
            <br />
            <span>Consume the context data:</span> Inside the consuming components, use the context consumer component to access the shared data. The consumer component uses a render prop or a function as a child pattern to receive the data and render the component accordingly.
            <br />
            <span>Update the context data:</span> To update the shared data, the provider component should define a state and provide a function to update that state. The consuming components can then trigger updates by invoking the update function provided by the provider component.

          <h4>What is useRef?</h4>
          <p>
          <strong>useRef</strong> is a hook provided by React that allows you to create a mutable reference to an element or value that persists across component renders. It is commonly used to access or modify DOM elements, store mutable values, and manage certain aspects of component lifecycle.
          <br />
          When you use the <strong>useRef</strong> hook, it returns a mutable object with a <strong>current</strong> property. The <strong>current</strong> property can be assigned a value, and it will persist between renders. The key feature of <strong>useRef</strong> is that updating the <strong>current</strong> property does not trigger a re-render of the component.
            <br />
            <br />
            Here are some common use cases of <strong>useRef</strong>:
            <br />
            <span>Accessing DOM elements:</span> You can use <strong>useRef</strong> to reference DOM elements and access their properties or methods. By assigning the <strong>ref</strong> attribute of an element to the value returned by <strong>useRef</strong>, you can then use <strong>ref.current</strong> to access the DOM element.
            <br />
            <span>Preserving values across renders:</span> Since the <strong>current</strong> property of a <strong>useRef</strong> object persists between renders, you can store a value and access it later without triggering a re-render. This can be useful for preserving values that need to be accessed or modified between renders.
            <br />
            <span>Managing focus and text selection:</span> <strong>useRef</strong> can be used to manage focus within a component. By assigning the <strong>ref</strong> attribute of an input or element to a <strong>useRef</strong> value, you can programmatically set focus or manipulate the selected text without triggering a re-render.
            <br />
            <span>Caching expensive calculations:</span> If you have a calculation or expensive operation that doesn't depend on the component's state, you can use <strong>useRef</strong> to store the result. The result will be memoized and accessible across renders without recomputing it.
